Line Track for Time
This program uses 1 NXT Line Follower Sensor to track a black line on a light(er) surface
for 10 seconds. There is a two second pause at the beginning of the program.

The threshold variable defined in this program may need to be changed for the line/surface your
robot is tracking and the lighting conditions.
