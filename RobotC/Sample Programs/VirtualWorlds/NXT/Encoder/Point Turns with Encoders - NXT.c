Point Turns with Encoders

This program instructs the robot to turn left, and then right, using feedback from the encoders.
There is a two second pause at the beginning of the program.

The used for feedback should be cleared just before it starts counting  using the
"nMotorEncoder(encoder) = 0;".  This helps ensure consistancy.
